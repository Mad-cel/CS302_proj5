Contributions:
	I wrote the BFS(), Output(), and canIspell(), functions whereas Haoren handled the graph class structure. Haoren also helped debug the canIspell function when it wasn't working.
		
Answers:
	The program uses the Edmond-Karp algorithm meaning that the program should be O(E^2),
	where E is the number of edges in the graph. One notable difference from previous 		
	projects is that this algorithm uses BFS(). Where as in the past I have use DFS() which
	would then mean we are using the Ford_fulkerson algorithm which has similar time complexity.
	The only data structures used in the graph structure is the vectors to store edges and nodes
	and the queue we use in the BFS function.
